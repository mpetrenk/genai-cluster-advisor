# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Cluster Recommendation Wizard

## ✅ Problem Solved!

The **frpc file missing error** has been resolved and the application is now **CrowdStrike Falcon compatible**.

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

1. **✅ Downloaded frpc file** - The missing `frpc_darwin_arm64_v0.3` file has been downloaded and configured
2. **✅ CrowdStrike compatibility** - Created security-aware version with fallback modes
3. **✅ Enhanced error handling** - Application gracefully handles security software interference
4. **✅ Public URL generation** - Shareable URLs now work properly

## 🚀 Launch Options

### Option 1: Quick Launch (Recommended)
```bash
cd "cluster recommendation wizard"
./launch_secure.sh
```

### Option 2: Direct Launch
```bash
cd "cluster recommendation wizard"
python3 app_improved.py
```

### Option 3: Original Version
```bash
cd "cluster recommendation wizard"
python3 app.py
```

## 📱 Expected Output

When you run the application, you'll see:

```
🧙‍♂️ Starting Cluster Recommendation Wizard...
==================================================
✅ Dataset loaded successfully: 300 samples
✅ TF-IDF vectorizer initialized
✅ AWS Bedrock client initialized
✅ frpc file exists and is executable
✅ Cluster Recommendation Wizard initialized successfully

🚀 Launching application...
📡 Generating publicly shareable URL...
🛡️  CrowdStrike compatibility: ENABLED

Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860
Running on public URL: https://[random-id].gradio.live

To create a public link, set `share=True` in `launch()`.
```

## 🌐 Access Your Application

- **Public Access:** https://[random-id].gradio.live (shareable with others)

## 🧪 Test the Application

Try these example inputs:

1. **Machine Learning Workload:**
   ```
   "I need to run deep learning model training on 10TB of image data. 
   Require 64 CPU cores, 256GB RAM, GPU acceleration, and support for 
   5 data scientists working concurrently."
   ```

2. **Real-time Processing:**
   ```
   "Real-time fraud detection system processing 1TB of transaction data 
   daily with sub-100ms latency requirements and 1000 concurrent users."
   ```

3. **Data Analytics:**
   ```
   "Data warehouse for business analytics with 50TB of historical data, 
   complex OLAP queries, and 100 concurrent business users requiring 
   sub-second response times."
   ```

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Common Issues:

1. **Port 7860 in use:**
   ```bash
   lsof -ti:7860 | xargs kill -9
   ```

2. **Missing dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Permission errors:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x launch_secure.sh
   chmod 644 *.py *.csv
   ```

4. **CrowdStrike blocking:**
   - See `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for detailed solutions
   - Use local mode: set `share=False` in the code

### Get Help:
- Check `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for CrowdStrike-specific issues
- Review `README.md` for complete documentation
- Test with: `python3 -c "from app_improved import ClusterRecommendationWizard; ClusterRecommendationWizard()"`

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know everything is working when you see:

- ✅ Dataset loaded successfully
- ✅ Vectorizer initialized  
- ✅ frpc file exists and is executable
- ✅ Public URL generated
- 🌐 Application accessible via both local and public URLs

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Launch the application** using one of the methods above
2. **Test with example workloads** to see recommendations
3. **Share the public URL** with colleagues for collaboration
4. **Customize the dataset** by modifying `generate_dataset.py`
5. **Configure AWS Bedrock** for full LLM analysis (optional)
