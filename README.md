## ‚ú® Features

### ü§ñ **GenAI-Powered Recommendations**
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** with LangChain and FAISS vector database
- **Semantic search** using HuggingFace embeddings for intelligent workload matching
- **300+ synthetic workload examples** across 18 enterprise workload types
- **Intelligent context understanding** beyond simple keyword matching

### üè¢ **Enterprise Workload Support**
- **Machine Learning Training** - GPU-accelerated deep learning workloads
- **Enterprise Data Warehouse** - Large-scale OLAP with thousands of concurrent users
- **Financial Analytics** - Regulatory reporting and risk modeling
- **Customer Intelligence** - Real-time personalization and Customer 360
- **Supply Chain Optimization** - Global logistics and demand forecasting
- **Business Intelligence** - Complex analytics and reporting

### üí∞ **Cost Optimization**
- **Cluster sizing recommendations** from small (2-4 nodes) to 4xlarge (8-25 nodes)
- **Cost estimates** ranging from $0.50/hour to $20.00/hour per node
- **Resource optimization** based on CPU, memory, and GPU requirements
- **Concurrent user scaling** considerations

### üîß **Technical Architecture**
- **Vector Database**: FAISS for efficient similarity search
- **Embeddings**: HuggingFace sentence-transformers for semantic understanding
- **Fallback System**: TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity when LangChain unavailable
- **Scalable Design**: Handles 100K+ documents with sub-second response times

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development

### Prerequisites
```bash
Python 3.8+
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mpetrenk/genai-cluster-advisor.git
cd genai-cluster-advisor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Locally
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_langchain_rag.py
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

## üìä How It Works

### 1. **RAG-Enhanced Analysis**
- Your workload description is converted to dense vector embeddings
- Vector database performs semantic similarity search across 300+ examples
- Top-5 most relevant workloads are retrieved with similarity scores
- Context-aware recommendations are generated based on similar patterns

### 2. **Intelligent Matching**
- **Semantic Understanding**: Captures meaning beyond keywords
- **Dense Representations**: Better context understanding than traditional search
- **Scalable Architecture**: Efficient for large knowledge bases
- **Hybrid Approach**: Graceful fallback to TF-IDF when needed

### 3. **Cost-Optimized Recommendations**
- **Resource Analysis**: CPU, memory, GPU requirements
- **Scaling Factors**: Data size, concurrent users, performance needs
- **Cluster Sizing**: Automatic recommendation from small to 4xlarge
- **Cost Estimation**: Transparent pricing per configuration

## üéØ Example Use Cases

### Enterprise Data Warehouse
```
Large-scale enterprise data warehouse processing 500TB of historical 
business data with complex multi-dimensional OLAP queries, star schema 
joins, and aggregations supporting 2,500 concurrent business analysts 
with mixed workload patterns.
```

### Financial Analytics
```
Enterprise financial reporting system processing 25TB of transaction 
history with complex regulatory calculations, risk modeling, and 
compliance reporting for 500 concurrent analysts across multiple time zones.
```

### Customer Intelligence
```
Customer 360 analytics platform processing 100TB of multi-channel 
customer data including web, mobile, and in-store interactions for 
real-time personalization serving 10,000 concurrent users with 
sub-second response times.
```

## üîç Dataset Preview
